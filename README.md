# FlowCapture

FlowCapture is an automation-driven tutorial generator.

It captures web workflows and automatically produces step-by-step visual tutorials.

It uses the OpenAI API to generate a list of Playwright-compatible automation steps, which are then executed.

Screenshots are captured after each step and included in the final Markdown tutorial document.

## Usage

```shell
npm run start
```

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains sample tutorials generated by FlowCapture.
